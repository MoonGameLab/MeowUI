Version 11.4 - Alpha (December 18 - 2023)
================================================
[FIXED][Manager][Control]
    * issue : When we notify the parent that teh child has dispatched an event we dispatch the parent event also
        and that caused some problems. For example when the child is Focused the parent dispatch the same event
        since it gets notifyed and it becomes the focused ctrl instead of the child.
    * solution :
        ALPHA -> commit: 77f0c70d1ea9396bc7b55596f5c4e729d99c8e3a
        STILL NEEDS TESTS.

Version 11.4 - Alpha (November 26 - 2023)
================================================
[ADDED][Manager][Control]
    * issue : The Frame is not focused when created.
    * solution : 
        - focusEnabled: flag to turn off/on the UI_FOCUS event for a control.
        * We set focusEnabled to false for the button control that intialts the Frame in its onClick cb.
        * We force the frame to focus using UI_ON_ADD event cb.
            ` 
                MeowUI.manager\setFocus(@)
                @onFocus! -- To switch the toolbar Color
            ` 

================================================
Version 11.4 - Alpha (November 24 - 2023)
================================================
[ADDED][Manager][Control] floats up a control when clicked && when makeTopWhenClicked flag is true.
    * funcs : setMakeTopWhenClicked | getMakeTopWhenClicked | makeTop | rollBackDepth
    * Note : if for some reason you don't want to set the flag and let the Manager handle the depth
        you can call makeTop where needed but make sure to call rollBackDepth on the control when unfocused.
    * commit: e2f926b557ba9d6b0a4bd24206035f4a94c1f8df
