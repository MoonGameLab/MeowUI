# MeowUI

Minimalist and light-weight library based on catui https://github.com/wilhantian/catui.

### Improvements

* Unlike catui this library has NO external dependencies.
* Has a built-in Chrono class (Timers manager). see Docs.
* Has the same level of extensibility as catui and more since it is based on moonscript class system.
* Lighter than catui.
* A LOT of assertion which improves the readability of the code and helps detect bugs.
* Unlike catui the controls have a unique id which prevent from attaching the same child multiple times.
* Fully documented.





###### Status 

* Core : Done
* Example Controls : To-Do
